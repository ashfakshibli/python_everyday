join - joins a list of strings with another string as a separator. 
replace - replaces one substring in a string with another.
startswith and endswith - determine if there is a substring at the start and end of a string, respectively. 
To change the case of a string, you can use lower and upper.
The method split is the opposite of join, turning a string with a certain separator into a list.

To find the maximum or minimum of some numbers or a list, you can use max or min.
To find the distance of a number from zero (its absolute value), use abs.
To round a number to a certain number of decimal places, use round.
To find the total of a list, use sum.
