Writing programs that actually do what they are supposed to do is just one component of being a good Python programmer.
It's also important to write clean code that is easily understood, even weeks after you've written it.

One way of doing this is to follow the Zen of Python, a somewhat tongue-in-cheek set of principles that serves as a guide to programming the Pythoneer way. Use the following code to access the Zen of Python.

"""

Some lines in the Zen of Python may need more explanation.
Explicit is better than implicit: It is best to spell out exactly what your code is doing. This is why adding a numeric string to an integer requires explicit conversion, rather than having it happen behind the scenes, as it does in other languages.
Flat is better than nested: Heavily nested structures (lists of lists, of lists, and on and on…) should be avoided.
Errors should never pass silently: In general, when an error occurs, you should output some sort of error message, rather than ignoring it.

There are 20 principles in the Zen of Python, but only 19 lines of text. 
The 20th principle is a matter of opinion, but our interpretation is that the blank line means "Use whitespace".
