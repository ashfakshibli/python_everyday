"""
Most Python code is either a module to be imported, or a script that does something. 
However, sometimes it is useful to make a file that can be both imported as a module and run as a script. 
To do this, place script code inside if __name__ == "__main__". 
This ensures that it won't be run if the file is imported.

def function():
   print("This is a module function from",__name__)

if __name__=="__main__":
   print("This is a script")


"""
When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it executes all of the code it finds in the file. Before executing the code, it defines a few special variables. 
For example, if the Python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value "__main__". If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module's name.
