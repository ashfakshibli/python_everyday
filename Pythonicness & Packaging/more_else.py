"""

The else statement is most commonly used along with the if statement, but it can also follow a for or while loop, which gives it a different meaning. 
With the for or while loop, the code within it is called if the loop finishes normally (when a break statement does not cause an exit from the loop).


"""

for i in range(10):
   if i == 999:
      break
else:
   print("Unbroken 1")

for i in range(10):
   if i == 5:
      break
else: 
   print("Unbroken 2")


"""
The first for loop executes normally, resulting in the printing of "Unbroken 1".
The second loop exits due to a break, which is why it's else statement is not executed.




The else statement can also be used with try/except statements. 
In this case, the code within it is only executed if no error occurs in the try statement.
