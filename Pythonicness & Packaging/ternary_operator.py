Conditional expressions provide the functionality of if statements while using less code. They shouldn't be overused, as they can easily reduce readability, but they are often useful when assigning variables. 
Conditional expressions are also known as applications of the ternary operator.

The ternary operator is so called because, unlike most operators, it takes three arguments.
